# Notes

While on the job hunt in the midst of applying, **be sure to make at least 5 commits per day** in order to not only display an active commit history, but to also keep your skills sharp and expanding as you continue searching.

There's a cliff of diminishing returns after meeting ~50% of a job's requirements, so don't feel discouraged if you're not a perfect match and consider applying anyway. If you do send in an application, while it's pending, be sure to start a project with any major technologies they're looking for that you can then update your portfolio with.

[Matching half of a jobâ€™s requirements might be as good as matching all of them](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/12/matching-half-of-a-jobs-requirements-might-still-get-you-an-interview.html)

# General Technologies

## **Recommended for max benefit-to-cost ratio**

-   For the client side:
    -   Redux
    -   [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
-   For the backend:
    -   Postgres (deploy with ElephantSQL)
    -   Mongo (deploy with Mongo themselves)
        -- Those check off the PERN/MERN keywords for search terms. Postgres is a relational SQL engine, very very similar in behavior (and even syntax) to MySQL. Mongo is NoSQL where you're basically storing large JSON "documents" in lieu of relational data

## Client-side

-   New CSS kits (MUI, Tailwind)
-   Redux (`redux toolkit` recommended)
-   Websockets
-   GraphQL (`apollo-client` recommended)
-   NextJS

## Backend

-   Websockets
-   GraphQL (`apollo-server` recommended)
-   PostgreSQL (**P**ERN stack)
-   MongoDB (**M**ERN stack)
-   Using an ORM or a query builder library instead of doing the raw DB setup and query writing yourself (like you would with `mysql` or `pg`)
-   Alternate webservers (Fastify, NestJS)

## DevOps

-   Deploying apps on multiple platforms (Fly.io, Heroku, Render, AWS, Azure, GCP)
-   Trying self-hosting of an app
-   Containerizing app with Docker and deploying those containers
-   Trying out serverless architecture

# Project Ideas

## Chirper/Blogs, but more features

-   Iterate over the same core code logic, but maybe with a new UI kit completely, or with a new database engine.

## Discord or Reddit bot

-   Hella fun, why not

## Classic todo list or note taking app

-   Purpose built to exactly what you need

## Custom node modules

-   Fetcher/API Service, SweetAlert wrapper
